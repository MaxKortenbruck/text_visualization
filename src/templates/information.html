    <h2>Information</h2>
	<p>
    This application enables text analyzation by visualizing coreferential mentions in news articles and drawing up statistics.
	<br>For every article you can choose which entities to mark in the text and which statistics you would like to see. You can also choose whether you would like to analyze a single article or to compare multiple articles side by side.
	This tool is a product of the course "Key Competences in Computer Science" which was held in the summer semester of 2021 at the University of Wuppertal and is based on the prototype constructed in the master thesis <a href='https://dke.uni-wuppertal.de/fileadmin/Abteilung/MT/news/MA_thesis_Zhukova.pdf'>"Automated Identification of Framing by Word Choice and Labeling to Reveal Media Bias in News Articles"</a> by Anastasia Zhukova. 
	<br>
	<br>How to use:
	<br>On the left there is an arrow-shaped button where you can open the navigation bar. There you are able to open the page with some information about the project, the article view's page or a page with the developers' contact information. 
	In the article view there is a list of available topics. When you chose a topic, you can either open the belonging statistics to this topic or you pick one or more article(s) belonging to the topic from the list that will be displayed on the right then. When an article is clicked, a new block will be displayed at the bottom of the screen where you can read the article or look at the statistics. There is one statistic that shows how the entities are distributed all over the text. You can choose whether you would like to see the statistic as a pie plot or as a bar plot. When you click on an entity in the plot another plot will open and show how the entity is mentioned in the text. You can again choose the type of the plot. To mark entities in the texts you can open the entities-list and click on specific entities or on the 'mark all entities'-button. To unmark an entity you can again click on its button or on the 'unmark all entities'-button to unmark all of them.
